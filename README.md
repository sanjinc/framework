Framework
=========

Webiny framework repository.

This is a set of components for building a (larger) PHP applications. Each of the component has its own documentation, just open open it inside GitHub. For example: https://github.com/Webiny/framework/tree/master/library/Webiny/Component/Cache

Some notes on coding:
=========
- before writing any code, make sure you have read PSR-1 coding standard (http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/)
- each package should have its own exception handler
- prefer the usage of 'use' keyword instead of writing the full class name with namespace
