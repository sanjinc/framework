framework
=========

Webiny framework repository. Private for now.

Testing.

Ovo je promjena.

Some notes on coding:
=========
- before writing any code, make sure you have read Webiny Coding Standard (documentation repo:for-developers\coding-standard)
- each package should have its own exception handler
- prefer the usage of 'use' keyword instead of writing the full class name with namespace
- config class?
- *ako funkcija prima StdObject onda i vraÄ‡a StdObject, i obrnuto ako prima string
