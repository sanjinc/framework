StdObject
=========
The standard object library is a set of classes that wraps the process of working with some common objects like arrays,
files, strings, URLs and dates into a objective style.

The benefit of working with StdObject instead of native objects is that you can chain several methods inside one call
which improves the speed how you write your code. And the code is fully objective.

Most of the internal classes inside Webiny are written using standard objects.
